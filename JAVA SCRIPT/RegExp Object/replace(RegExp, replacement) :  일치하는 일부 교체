  A String method that executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.

   Syntax: replace(RegExp, replacement)

Example1)

var myCourse = "WEB222";
myCourse = myCourse.replace(/222/g,"322")  

console.log( myCourse );  // WEB322 

Example2)

const p = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?';

console.log(p.replace('dog', 'monkey'));
// expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy monkey. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"


const regex = /Dog/i;
console.log(p.replace(regex, 'ferret'));
// expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"
