                        Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?
                        <br>
                        How does responsive design relate to web technologies?
                        <br>
                        What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?

                        Reactive web design is a web development approach that dynamically changes the website according
                        to the size and direction of the device's screen (phone, PC, etc.) used when the user views the
                        website. In the broad sense of a responsive website, it is one website corresponding to various
                        characteristics of various devices, which also means that the layout changes depending on the
                        size of the browser (screen size) in real-time. These responsive web designs are usually defined
                        on mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets using the principle of "mobile-first" and
                        then extended to larger screens.

                        <br>
                        Also, To find out how responsive websites react quickly, you can check the browser window's size
                        by changing it.

                            by looking at this site. </a>
                        <br>Through this course, I learned object-based script programming language
                        JavaScript and Node.js, HTML, and CSS. JavaScript causes web pages to be dynamically changed
                        like a live web. In addition, JavaScript runs on a web browser to prevent the overload of
                        servers and is included in HTML documents, making it easy and fast to use.
                        Node.js is a program that enables JavaScript to be used on servers and has the advantage of
                        quickly applying server technology using JavaScript without acquiring a new language.

                        HTML is the most basic markup language for creating web pages and is responsible for the content
                        and structure of web pages. CSS is a stylesheet language used to style documents such as HTML,
                        and although styles can be specified in HTML,
                        CSS is used because it has various advantages
                        such as reusability and improved management.

                        This semester, I first learned various web technologies. From the bottom of my heart, I had a
                        lot of fun learning this subject.
                        To be honest, I wanted to learn more about the web while learning web courses when I was tired
                        and lost interest after learning several subjects at once.
                        It was also interesting to learn about various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions and learn how
                        they are implemented on the web, and I was so excited to implement these functions myself and
                        create the web as I wanted. I was also surprised to see the professor re-read the class
                        materials (slides or records) or search YouTube alone, wondering about various functions while
                        doing the assignment, and I thought maybe I really like WEB classes.
                        I still have a lot of lacking skills, but I hope the day will come when I can work hard and
                        accumulate what I want faster and easier next semester. And thank you so much, professor, for
                        teaching me many different skills!
