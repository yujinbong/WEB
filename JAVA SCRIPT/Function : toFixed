The toFixed() method converts a number to fixed-point notation with the indicated number of decimalPlaces (rounding the result where necessary) and 
then returns its value as a string.
If more decimal places are required than was present in the original number, 
the toFixed() method will pad the result with 0's after the decimal place.
Note

The toFixed() method will round the resulting value if necessary.
The toFixed() method will pad the resulting value with 0's if there are not enough decimal places in the original number.
The toFixed() method does not change the value of the original number.


*  The toFixed() method formats a number to a specific number of digits to the right of the decimal (rounding the result).

Example1)

var totn_number = 123.456789;

console.log(totn_number.toFixed()); //123
console.log(totn_number.toFixed(1)); //123.5
console.log(totn_number.toFixed(2)); //123.46
console.log(totn_number.toFixed(8)); //123.45678900
