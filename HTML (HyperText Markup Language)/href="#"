What is href="#" and why is it used?


A hash - # within a hyperlink specifies an html element id to which the window should be scrolled.
href="#some-id" would scroll to an element on the current page such as <div id="some-id">.
href="//site.com/#some-id" would go to site.com and scroll to the id on that page.

href="#" doesn't specify an id name, but does have a corresponding location - the top of the page. 
Clicking an anchor with href="#" will move the scroll position to the top.
