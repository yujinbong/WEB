 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web browser page. 
Hypertext is text with hyperlinks.
The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's text and images for the user.
  The markup symbols/indicators are often called “tags”, which are enclosed in angle brackets 
Most html tags come in pairs e.g. <p> and </p>
<p> being the opening of the tag and 
</p> being the closing of the tag. 
In between these tags you can add text-based content.
There are some tags that are not paired – these tags are known as empty tags, such as <img />
